# SQL-Project
The purpose of this project is to create a database to assist a business owner with daily shop operations and to, additionally, provide the ability to obtain helpful business insights. This database will provide a manager with the ability to view information regarding other stores and their customer orders and their performance. Furthermore, the pizza shop model is built around the fact that there is no dine-in option. Customers can either place their order through a third-party delivery service or they can order at establishment via walk-in. As the business continues to grow, the possibility of expanding the business and adding a dine-in experience is being questioned, therefore the creation of this database will not only provide the ability monitor customers' reviews regarding the service but will also allow to track customersâ€™ suggestions about having a dine-in option being offered.
